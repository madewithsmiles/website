## Spring 2017 Projects

### Computer Vision: Recognition CV

- Web API
  - Open-source toolkit for computer vision projects on the web.
    - Features image processing and analysis algorithms in OpenCV.

**Project Sherlock** is a Cloud-Based Machine Learning and Aritifical Intelligence API. We implement, optimize, and rigorously test powerful algorithms and then release our work to the public in the form of a documented API.

### Social Networks: Lively

- Mobile Application
  - Update your current status and activity.
    - View what your friends are doing and see whoâ€™s free.

We all hate those moments when we're free, but our closest friends already have plans. **Project Lively** aims to eliminate those moments by revealing your friends that are close by and immediately available. We use graph theory, machine learning, AI, and data science techniques to ensure that you spend less time scrolling through your phone and more time with your friends.

###Accessibility: Whisper

- Full-stack Web Application/Browser Plugin
  - Create an accessible web through voice recognition and navigation.

We find it strange that accessibility is a secondary or hidden function on most browsers and search engines. With **Project Whisper**, those who are disabled will be able to use their voices to access the full power of the internet. We use the Wit.ai API for its Natural Language, Voice Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis capabilities to build a browser that puts accessibility first.
