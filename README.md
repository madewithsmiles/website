## Spring 2017 Projects

### Computer Vision: Sherlock

- Web API
  - Open-source toolkit for computer vision projects on the web.
    - Features image processing and analysis algorithms in OpenCV.

**Project Sherlock** is a Cloud-Based Machine Learning and Aritifical Intelligence API. We implement, optimize, and rigorously test powerful algorithms and then release our work to the public in the form of a documented API.

### Speech Recognition: Luna

- Use Kaldi to train neural nets, S3 for hosting, EC2 for computation, and SQS for queuing

Speech consists of many features that are not built into personal assistants like Alexa and Google Home. We aim to build a seemless conversational personal assistant that considers prosody in speech. By feeding corpora that contain thousands of hours of annotated audio into CTC networks, our assistant will be able to adjust to speakers' uncertainty and identity.
